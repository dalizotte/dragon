    <h1>Program Description</h1>
<br> <!--Who, What, When, Where, Why.-->
        <h3 id="who">Who is the program for?</h3>
            <p>This program is designed for a competative or hobbiest Jiu-jitsu practitioner to improve stregth
            in the areas neccesary for the sport; as well as, have supplemental exercise to enssure that 
            the practitioner doesnt become lopsided or weak in areas not involved while rolling 
<br>
        <h3 id="what">What is the program?</h3>
            <p>This program is a 3 day split with an optional fourth day, designed to suplement a standard or 
            competative Brazilian Jiu-jitsu practice.</p>
<br>
        <h3 id="when">When to use the program</h3>
            <p>These workouts are for your days where you are off of the mats. Most of your training should be
            <em>skill training</em> or live rolls on the mats. This is for the day you dont train.</p>
<br>
        <h3 id="where">Where to preform the workouts in this program</h3>
            <p>These workouts can be executed at home or in the gym. Minimal equipment is needed ie. rubber bands,
               dumbbells, kettlebells, but we will mostly be relying on bodyweight.</p>
<br>
               <h3 id="why">Why use this program?</h3>
            <p>Jiu-jitsu is a highly demanding sport on the body, and whether we are rolling in practice, or competing 
               in local or national competitions its important to take care of our bodies. Many muscle inbalances can 
               occure when participating in a sport like this, which can then lead to injuries, either chronic or accute.
               Therefore its important to address these imbalances early on in our training <strong>AS WELL AS</strong> 
               training to add strength and flexability for maximum performance in our sport.</p>
